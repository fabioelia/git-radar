# 📡 Git Radar

A local-first Electron app that tracks **what your team actually shipped** each release
cycle. Merged PRs come in through the **GitHub CLI**, a **local Gemma LLM** (via Ollama)
organizes them into evolving **buckets of work**, and at sprint's end you get the story
with numbers:

- *How much time did we spend chasing defects for feature X?*
- *Which features were built but are entirely behind flags — invisible to users?*
- *How much of the cycle went to release mechanics (develop → stage → main) vs. real work?*
- *Did what we shipped match the sprint priorities?* — via **MCP** (e.g. Atlassian/Jira)

Everything runs on your machine. PR titles, bodies, and analysis never leave it.

> The full product thinking lives in [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## How it works

```
gh pr list ──► PR store ──► Gemma classifies into buckets ──► deterministic stats ──► sprint report
 (merged PRs    (JSON,        (structured JSON outputs,         (defect turnaround,     (LLM narrative;
  in the         local)        buckets = topics, reorganized     hidden features,        may call MCP tools
  sprint window)               as the cycle evolves)             timeline per branch)    for planned-vs-actual)
```

1. **Track a repo** and write its *release-cycle prompt* — free text the LLM reads on
   every pass, e.g.:

   > The newton monorepo releases every 3 weeks. General development merges into
   > `develop`; at code freeze we start merging into `stage`; we release by merging
   > `stage` into `main`. Feature work is usually gated behind LaunchDarkly flags.

2. **📡 Scan** — pulls PRs merged in the sprint window via `gh`, then classifies new
   ones in batches with Gemma: bucket, work type (feature/defect/chore/infra/…),
   behind-flag + flag name, user-facing, one-line summary. Buckets are *topics*, never
   types — a checkout bug fix lands in the **Checkout** bucket as a `defect`, so
   defect-chasing time aggregates per feature. Buckets get reorganized (merged/renamed)
   by a second LLM pass when they proliferate.

3. **📝 Report** — Gemma writes the sprint report from deterministically computed stats
   (the LLM never does arithmetic). With MCP servers configured, it can call their
   tools first — e.g. fetch Jira sprint priorities — and write a *planned vs. actual*
   section.

## Requirements

| Tool | Why | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js ≥ 20.11 | run the app | nodejs.org |
| pnpm | package manager | `corepack enable` (bundled with Node) |
| GitHub CLI | fetch merged PRs (your existing auth, incl. SSO/Enterprise) | `brew install gh && gh auth login` |
| Ollama + Gemma | local analysis | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), then `ollama pull gemma3:12b` (or `gemma3:4b` on lighter machines) |

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

(`pnpm-workspace.yaml` pre-approves electron's postinstall — pnpm skips dependency
build scripts by default, and electron needs its script to download the platform binary.)

Then: **＋ Add repository** → enter `owner/repo`, the release-cycle prompt, cycle length,
and (optionally) tracked base branches like `develop, stage, main` → **📡 Scan**.

Health dots in the sidebar show `gh` auth and Ollama/model status at a glance.

## MCP: wiring in planning tools

Git Radar is an MCP *client*. In **Settings → MCP servers**, add stdio servers as a JSON
array; the report generator exposes their tools to the LLM:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "atlassian",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse"]
  }
]
```

Any stdio MCP server works (`{name, command, args, env?}`). Tool calls are capped at 5
per report and run through a prompt-driven loop, so it works even with models that lack
native function-calling. If a server is down, the report still generates — just without
the planned-vs-actual section.

## What the numbers mean

- **Defect turnaround** — Σ (merge time − open time) over defect PRs in a bucket:
  wall-clock exposure to defect work, not engineer-hours.
- **Hidden feature (🙈)** — a bucket whose feature PRs are *all* behind flags or not
  user-facing: built, but users can't see it.
- **Avg PR cycle** — mean open→merge time across the sprint's merged PRs.
- **Merge timeline** — merges per day, stacked by base branch, which makes the
  develop→stage→main release phases visible across the cycle.

## Development

```bash
pnpm test         # node --test: stats engine, store, analyzer pipeline (stubbed LLM/gh/MCP), parsers
```

- `src/main/services/` — testable, dependency-injected services (no electron imports)
- `src/renderer/` — no-build vanilla ES modules; views are pure HTML-string renderers
- Data lives in Electron's `userData` dir as plain JSON (override with `GIT_RADAR_DATA_DIR`)

## Troubleshooting

- **`ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING` when running `pnpm`** — your corepack is
  outdated (common with homebrew-installed Node) and can't load modern pnpm. Fix:
  `npm install -g corepack@latest && corepack enable pnpm` — or skip corepack entirely
  with `npm i -g pnpm` (pnpm reads the `packageManager` pin itself).
- **"Cannot reach Ollama"** — start it: `ollama serve`, and check the URL in Settings.
- **Yellow `llm` dot** — Ollama is up but the configured model isn't pulled: `ollama pull gemma3:12b`.
- **Classification feels shallow** — try a bigger Gemma variant, or raise `num_ctx`
  (Settings) if your PRs have long bodies. Smaller models stay parseable thanks to
  JSON-schema-constrained outputs; they're just less nuanced.
- **`gh` errors** — `gh auth status` must succeed in a terminal first; for GitHub
  Enterprise, `gh auth login --hostname your.host`.
