# Git Radar — Design

## The goal, restated

Teams that ship on a release train (e.g. "the Newton monorepo releases every 3 weeks:
develop → stage at code freeze → main at release") have a recurring blind spot: **what
actually happened this cycle?** Planning tools show what was *intended*. The merge
history shows what was *done* — but as hundreds of disconnected PRs.

Git Radar closes that gap. It watches the repos you care about, pulls every PR merged
during the cycle, and uses a **local LLM (Gemma via Ollama)** to organize raw merges
into evolving **buckets of work** — features, initiatives, subsystems. At the end of
the sprint it answers questions like:

- *How much time did we spend chasing defects for feature X?*
- *Which features were built but are entirely behind flags, invisible to users?*
- *How much of the cycle went to release mechanics vs. real work?*
- *Did what we shipped match what we planned?* (via MCP → Jira/Atlassian)

It is a **retrospective instrument**, not a dashboard of vanity metrics. The output is
a narrative + numbers a team lead can read in two minutes at sprint review.

## Why these particular ingredients

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — zero credential management. The user is already logged in;
  `gh` handles auth, SSO, and GitHub Enterprise hosts. We shell out to
  `gh pr list --json …` and never store tokens.
- **Local Gemma LLM** — PR titles and bodies are often confidential. Everything is
  analyzed on-device through Ollama's API; nothing leaves the machine. Gemma 3 12B
  handles classification well; structured outputs (JSON-schema-constrained sampling)
  make it reliable regardless of model size.
- **MCP client** — planning context lives elsewhere (Jira, Linear, Confluence…).
  Rather than building N integrations, Git Radar is an MCP *client*: configure any
  stdio MCP server (e.g. Atlassian via `mcp-remote`) and the LLM can call its tools
  while writing the sprint report — fetching sprint priorities to produce the
  "planned vs. actual" section.

## Core loop

                                                                                 ▼ (LLM merges/renames)

```

1. **Sync** — fetch PRs merged inside the sprint window (optionally filtered to the
   tracked base branches: develop/stage/main). Re-sync merges by PR number and never
   loses prior classification.
2. **Categorize** — batches of ~10 PRs go to Gemma with the repo's context prompt and
   the *current* bucket list. The model assigns each PR to an existing bucket or coins
   a new one, plus per-PR annotations: `work_type` (feature/defect/chore/infra/docs/
   test/refactor/release), `behind_flag` + flag name, `user_facing`, one-line summary.
3. **Reorganize** — buckets drift as the sprint progresses. A second LLM pass proposes
   `merge` / `rename` / `update_description` operations to keep 5–12 coherent buckets.
   Runs automatically when buckets proliferate, or on demand.
4. **Stats** — pure, deterministic JS over the annotated PRs (the LLM never does
   arithmetic): per-bucket type breakdown, churn, defect turnaround time, hidden
   (fully-flagged) features, merges-per-day timeline per base branch, contributors.
5. **Report** — Gemma writes a markdown sprint report from the stats + buckets, plus a
   deterministic per-PR ledger (title, author, work type, churn, changed files; grouped
   by bucket, with unclassified PRs listed explicitly) so the narrative is grounded in
   what actually merged even before — or when — classification has run. If MCP servers
   are configured, the model may call their tools first (prompt-driven tool loop, max 5
   calls) to pull sprint priorities and compare plan vs. reality.

## Key design decisions

### Buckets are *topics*, not *types*
A bug fix for checkout belongs in the **Checkout** bucket with `work_type: defect` —
not in a "Bug Fixes" bucket. This is what makes "time spent chasing defects for X"
answerable: defect time is aggregated *within* each feature bucket. The classifier
prompt enforces this, and "Release Operations" is the one mandated structural bucket
(develop→stage→main merges, back-merges) so release mechanics don't pollute features.

### The release-cycle prompt is first-class data
The user's free-text description of how the repo releases ("develop is mainline, we
freeze into stage, release from main…") is stored per repo and injected into **every**
LLM call. The model uses it to interpret branch names, what counts as release ops,
what "code freeze" means for late merges, etc. We deliberately do *not* try to parse
this into config — it's context, and LLMs are good at context.

### Deterministic numbers, narrative prose
Anything numeric (counts, hours, percentages) is computed in `stats.js` and handed to
the model, which is instructed to use the numbers given and never invent data. The LLM
adds judgment (what mattered, what's risky), not arithmetic.

**"Time chasing defects"** is approximated as **defect turnaround time**: the sum of
(merge time − open time) over defect PRs in a bucket. It's wall-clock exposure to
defect work, not engineer-hours — the report is told to present it as such.

**"Hidden feature"** = a bucket with ≥1 feature PR where *every* feature PR is either
behind a flag or not user-facing. That's the "we built it but users can't see it" case.

### Prompt-driven MCP tool loop (no native tool-calling required)
Gemma's native function-calling support in Ollama is inconsistent across sizes. The
report generator instead describes available MCP tools in the prompt and asks the
model to reply with `{"tool_call": {name, arguments}}` JSON when it wants data. We
parse, call the MCP server, feed the result back, loop (≤5 calls). This works with
*any* model and degrades gracefully: no MCP servers → the section is skipped.

### Sprints are explicit windows
Each repo has a cycle length (default 3 weeks). A sprint is a stored {start, end}
window; "New sprint" rolls over from the previous end date. Buckets live per sprint —
each cycle starts a fresh radar, which matches the retrospective framing.

### Local-first storage
A JSON document store in Electron's `userData` dir (`git-radar.json` for settings/
repos/sprints, one file per sprint for PRs/buckets/reports). Atomic writes
(tmp + rename). No server, no DB to install, trivially inspectable and portable.

## Architecture

```
src/main/                 Electron main process (ESM)
  main.js                 window + lifecycle
  preload.cjs             contextBridge API (sandboxed)
  ipc.js                  IPC surface; wires services; progress events
  services/
    store.js              JSON persistence (no electron imports → unit-testable)
    github.js             gh CLI wrapper (execFile, never a shell)
    ollama.js             Ollama /api/chat client, JSON-schema structured outputs
    mcp.js                MCP client manager (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, stdio)
    prompts.js            all prompt builders + JSON schemas
    analyzer.js           sync / categorize / reorganize / report pipeline (DI'd)
    stats.js              pure statistics engine
    util.js               json extraction, truncation, time helpers
src/renderer/             no-build vanilla ES modules
  index.html, styles.css
  js/app.js               state + actions + routing
  js/api.js               typed wrapper over window.gitRadar
  js/views/{dashboard,report,settings}.js
  js/components/{charts,markdown}.js   hand-rolled SVG charts + md renderer
tests/                    node --test against the pure services
```

Services take dependencies by injection (`createAnalyzer({store, ollama, github,
mcp, emit})`) so the whole pipeline is testable with stubs — no Electron, no network.

## Cut from v1 (deliberately)

- Auto-sync scheduling (manual "Scan" keeps runs predictable and cheap on a local LLM)
- Engineer-hour estimation beyond PR turnaround time (would be fiction)
- Review/comment ingestion (valuable later for "review latency" stats)
- Cross-repo rollups (per-repo radar first; the store supports it later)
- Git Radar acting as an MCP *server* (exposing sprint stats to other agents) — the
  natural next step once the data model settles.
